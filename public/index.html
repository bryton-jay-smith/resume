                All I've wanted to do is program, and I've worked hard to learn what I needed to get started. After earning an associate degree in Linux System Administration, I worked in tech support for a few years before I sought my certification in Full-Stack Web Development through the University of Arizona. I'm a very quick learner, and I love a challenge; itâ€™s a big part of why I create step-saving tools. I enjoy when a problem comes up that completely baffles me. It isn't fun to solve a problem if you already know how - I like learning a new skill or tool to overcome problems I never saw coming. I enjoy creating time-saving packages for use in development as well as making packages, stylesheets, and script pages that help me avoid rewriting code for new projects but are also flexible enough to be used in unanticipated situations. I'm skilled at making a system work with as few steps as possible. The last step in every project I do is re-create the application using as few pages, scripts, or lines of code as I can. I like to learn and solve problems that make me feel challenged. I enjoy the combat of unexpected errors, and I want to create better methods for programmers after me to avoid the same mistakes.
